Workshop held on 27 August 2022 

To effectively find what our dataðŸ“„ wants to say, we need some visualization toolsðŸ‘€ and these form the basis of any kind of data preprocessing or exploratory data analysis!  ðŸ“Š So, the Data Science & AI Club is going to take a workshop on the following topics which seem to be trivial but are the backbone of any state-of-the-art Machine Learning project!ðŸ’¡
Numpy
Pandas
Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
We plan to keep this workshop on Saturday, 27th of August from 9:30 am onwards. So, mark your calendarsðŸ—“ and be a part of this amazing workshop which will equip you to get a feel of the data before you actually get down to modeling it!
